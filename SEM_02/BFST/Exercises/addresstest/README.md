# Addresstest

* *Black box testing*: In this exercise, you will construct a massive test suite (in collaboration with your classmates) for the address parser you are writing (`Address.java`). We have given you access to a shared git repository with all the files. This is essentially a fresh clone of the live coding repo, but with `Address.java` left out, since you will be using your own. In the  `app/src/test/java/bfst22/addressparser` folder of the repository, you have your own file by the name of <username>.java, which you can add test cases to. The file `TRBJ.java` already contains a simple test cases for you to look at. Please only modify your own file. If you do not have an account on `github.itu.dk`, please create one and let us know, then we'll add you as a collaborator on the repo. The steps you should follow to get started are:

  1. *WAIT UNTIL THE EXERCISES; THE FOLLOWING REPOSITORY WILL NOT BE OPEN BEFORE*
  2. git clone <https://github.itu.dk/trbj/addresstest>
  3. Copy your own Address.java into the src/main/java/bfst21/addressparser folder of the repository.
  4. Either run the tests through your IDE, or through the gradle test task from the project, e.g., from the terminal by typing: ./gradlew test
  5. Fix any errors in your Address.java, and rerun tests (remember to run "git pull" often to get the newest test cases from your classmates)
  6. When no bugs are found by any test case, add a new test case to your own test file.
