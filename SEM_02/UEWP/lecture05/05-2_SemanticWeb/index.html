<h1>The Scream Painting</h1>
<p><b>The Scream</b> is the popular name given to a composition created by Norwegian <i>Expressionist</i> artist <strong>Edvard Munch</strong> in 1893. The original German title given by Munch to his work was <i>Der Schrei der Natur</i> (The Scream of Nature), and the Norwegian title is <i>Skrik</i> (Shriek). The agonised face in the painting has become one of the <u>most iconic images of art</u>, seen as symbolising the <mark>anxiety of the human condition</mark>.</p>
<p>Munch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sunlight turned the clouds <span style="color:red">"a blood red"</span>. He sensed an <span style="color:green">"infinite scream passing through nature"</span>.</p>

<h2>Sources of inspiration</h2>
<p>In his diary in an entry headed "Nice 22 January 1892", Munch wrote:</p>
<p><q cite="https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/the-mysterious-road-of-the-scream-by-edvard-munch/">One evening I was walking along a path, the city was on one side and the fjord below. I felt tired and ill. I stopped and looked out over the fjord-the sun was setting, and the clouds turning blood red. I sensed a scream passing through nature; it seemed to me that I heard the scream. I painted this picture, painted the clouds as actual blood. The color shrieked. This became The Scream.</q><sup>[2]</sup>.</p>

<h2>Versions of Painting</h2>
<p>Edvard Munch created four versions of the compositions created as both paintings and pastels.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="The National Gallery of the Museum">NAM</abbr> in Oslo holds one of two painted versions. The Munch Museum holds the other painted version and a pastel version from 1893. The fourth version in pastel, 1895 was sold for $119,922,600 at Sotheby's Impressionist and Modern Art auction on May 2, 2012.</p>
