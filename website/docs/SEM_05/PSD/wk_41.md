# (7) Compiling Micro-C

An abstract machine consists of:
- a program `p`: array of instructions as bytecodes, 0-indexed addresses
- a program counter `pc`: indicating next instruction to be executed
- a stack `s`: integer stack, 0-indexed
- a stack pointer `sp`: points at the top of the stack
- a base pointer `bp`: points to the base of the current frame (function scope)

This state (these values) are changed according to the program being run, such that a bytecode might indicate pushing an integer `x` to the stack, such that the `stack[++sp] = x`. The `pc` is, generally, incremented after each instruction, unless the instruction is `GOTO a` (then `sp = a`) or some sort of jump condition.
