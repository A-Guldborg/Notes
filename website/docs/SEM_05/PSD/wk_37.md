# (3) Context-free grammar

Read about parser automatons and parsing stack analysis, see page 44 in the PLC book. Use `fsyacc -v --module ExprPar ExprPar.fsy` to generate `ExprPar.fsyacc.output` file, which shows the automaton generated.

If there are any ambiguities, add %left, %right or %nonassoc keywords to decide precedence rules. This is shown by error messages saying `shift/reduce` or `reduce/reduce` when using the `fsyacc` command.

If there are no precedence rules between addition, subtraction and multiplication, it will state that it does not know if it should interpret it as `(a-b) + c` or `a - (b+c)`. 

`shift` (read) means reading the next symbol in a matter such as `a - (b+c)`, where `reduce` means reducing `a-b` to an `Expr` before proceeding, effectively making the `(a-b) + c` which is what we want.

## Associativity

`a + b + c` can be either `(a + b) + c` (left-associative) or `a + (b + c)` (right-associative).

## Precedence

`a + b * c` can be either `(a + b) * c` (+ has higher precedence) or `a + (b * c)` (* has higher precedence).
