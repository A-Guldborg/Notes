## Scope

Dynamic: variable occurence refers to the most recent binding of the variable name.  
Static: (lexical scope) variable occurence refers to the innermost enclosing binding of the variable name.

## First-order functions

First-order functional programming languages cannot apply functions to functions or return functions from a function. That is achieved by [higher-order functions](#higher-order-functions).

## Higher-order functions

In some functional programming languages such as F#, it is possible to treat functions as values, thus having a function that accepts a function as a parameter or a function that returns another function.

A good example is `List.map` which is a function that takes a function and a list and then applies the function to each element of the list. The implementation is recursive but the recursion has been abstracted away by this method, allowing for better readability. Likewise, F# has the pipe operator `|>` such that `x |> f` is equivalent to `f(x)` (invoking `f ` with `x`). Having a list `xs` of integers can thus be sent through multiple functions without losing readability:

```fs
xs |> filter (fun x -> x>10) |> map (fun x -> x*x) |> sum
```

It is also possible in Java and C# etc., but at the cost of readability.
