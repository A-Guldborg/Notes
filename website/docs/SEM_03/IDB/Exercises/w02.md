Thanks to Frederik Petersen (frepe) for help throughout several queries!

## Basic queries

**(1) The name and record of all sports sorted by name.**

```sql
select Name, Record from Sports order by Name
```

**(2) The name of all sports with at least one result.**

```sql
select Name, Min(Results.result) as worst from Sports join Results on Sports.Id = Results.SportId group by Sports.Id
```

**(3) The number of athletes who have competed in at least one sport.**

```sql
Select count(distinct people) from people
join results on people.id = results.peopleid
```

**(4) The ID and name of athletes who have at least twenty results.**

```sql
Select Id, Name from people
join results on people.id = results.peopleid
group by (Id, Name)
having count(results) >= 20
```

**(5) The ID, name and gender description of all athletes that currently hold a record.**

```sql
Select distinct People.Id, People.Name, Gender.Description from people 
Join Gender on gender.gender = people.gender
Join results on results.peopleid = people.id
Join sports on sports.record = results.result
Where results.sportid = sports.id
```

**(6) For each sport, where some athlete holds the record, the name of the sport and the number of athletes that hold a record in that sport; the last column should be named “numathletes”.**

```sql
Select Sports.name, count(distinct results.peopleid) as numathletes from Sports
Join Results on sports.id = results.sportid
Where sports.record = results.result
Group by Sports.name
```

*Question: How can the total number of people that have equaled a record in some sport, which is 38, be larger than the 33 from the previous query?*

Because one person holds the record in multiple sports.

**(7) The ID and name of each athlete that has at least twenty results in the triple jump, their best result, along with the difference between the record and their best result. The second-to-last column should be named “best” while the last column should be named “difference”. The last column should always contain non-negative values and should preferably be formatted to show at least one digit before the decimal point and exactly two digits after the decimal point.**

```sql
select distinct people.id, people.name, max(results.result) as best, to_char(sports.record - max(results.result), '0D99') as difference from people
join results on people.id = results.peopleid
join sports on sports.id = results.sportid
where sports.name = 'Triple Jump'
group by people.id, people.name, sports.record
having count(results) >= 20
```

**(8) The ID, name and gender description of all athletes who participated in the competition held in Hvide Sande in 2009.**

```sql
Select distinct people.id, people.name, gender.description from People
join gender on people.gender = gender.gender
join results on people.id = results.peopleid
join competitions on results.competitionid = competitions.id
where competitions.place = 'Hvide Sande' and extract(year from competitions.held) = 2009
```

**(9) The name and gender description of all people with a last name that starts with a “J” and ends with a “sen” (e.g., Jensen, Jansen, Johansen).**

```sql
Select people.name, gender.description from people
join gender on gender.gender = people.gender
where people.name like '% J%sen'
```

**(10) For each result, the name of the athlete, the name of the sport, and the percentage of the record achieved by the result (a result that is a record should therefore appear as 100; this column should be named “percentage”). Preferably, format the last column to show only whole numbers, as well as the % sign, you can use CASE to detect when the result is NULL and when not.**

```sql
Select people.name, sports.name, 
CASE
    When results.result is NULL then '0%'
    Else to_char(results.result / sports.record * 100, '999%')
END
as percentage from results
join people on results.peopleid = people.id
join sports on results.sportid = sports.id
```

**(11) The number of athletes with some incomplete result registrations.**

```sql
Select count(distinct people) from results 
join people on people.id = results.peopleid
where results.result is NULL
```

**(12) For each sport, show the ID and name of the sport and the best performance over all athletes and competitions. This last column should be called ‘maxres’ and should be formatted to show at least one digit before the decimal point and exactly two digits after the decimal point. The query result should be ordered by the sport ID.**

```sql
select sports.id, sports.name, max(results.result) as maxres from sports
join results on sports.id = results.sportid
group by sports.id, sports.name
order by sports.id
```

**(13) Show the ID and name of athletes who hold a record in at least two sports, along with the total number of their record-setting or record-equaling results.**

```sql
select people.id, people.name, count(results.result) from people
join results on results.peopleid = people.id
join sports on results.sportid = sports.id
where results.sportid = sports.id and results.result = sports.record
group by people.id, people.name
having count(distinct results.sportid) >= 2
```
