# Models

## Physical Models

...describe the physical components and layout of a distributed system, including the hardware, networking infrastructure, and geographical locations of the various components.

## Architectural models

...describe the logical structure and organization of a distributed system, including the relationships between the various components and the interfaces and protocols they use to communicate with each other.

## Fundamental models

...describe the underlying principles and mechanisms that govern the behavior of a distributed system, including topics such as fault tolerance, consistency, and scalability.

## System models

Network:

- Asynchronous
- Partially synchronous (Clock+timeout to detect failures)
- Synchronous

Crashes:

- Byzantine failures
- Crash-failures
- No crashes
