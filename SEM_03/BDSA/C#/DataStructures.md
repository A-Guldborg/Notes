# Data Structures

|Structure|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Collections|Regular sets, lists etc. like Java|
|Generics|Type defined collections, e.g. a Collection that always gets and gives a specific type T.|
|Iterators (Producers, IEnumerable)|Not required to create a return list and add to this. Instead call “yield return value” for each value that should be added to the returnlist. <br> Using yield break will stop the function and return the enumerable. |
|Properties||
|Interpolated strings|Using variables inside strings with the syntax `$"{name}, {age}"` will print something like `Andreas, 22`|
|Enumerations|Equivalent to Java Enums|
|Generic classes||
|Regular Expressions|Requires the package `System.Text.RegularExpressions` and means that with an @ in front of a string, it will be registered as a regex.|
